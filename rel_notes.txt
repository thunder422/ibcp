	table.cpp       - corrected 2 character operator table entries
	test_parser.cpp - added operators tests


Release 0.0.8 (2010-03-08)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.7 updated after testing the
	parser string routines.  New (listed first) and updated
	files include:

	parser4.txt     - string output from the test_parser program

	parser.cpp      - removed no closing quote check
	test_parser.cpp - added string tests


Release 0.0.7 (2010-03-07)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.6 updated after testing the
	parser number routines.  New (listed first) and updated
	files include:

	parser3.txt     - number output from the test_parser program

	ibcp.h          - added token error length
	parser.cpp      - added token error length
	parser1.txt     - updated for change in error output
	test_parser.cpp - changed error output, added number tests


Release 0.0.6 (2010-03-06)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.5 updated after testing the
	parser identifier routines.  New (listed first) and updated
	files include:

	parser2.txt     - identifier output from the test_parser program

	ibcp.h          - corrected problem with define functions
	parser.cpp      - corrected problem with define functions
	table.cpp       - fixed data type for internal string functions
	test_parser.cpp - command line argument, added identifier tests


Release 0.0.5 (2010-03-01)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.4 plus the initial
	implementation of the Parser class (all parser routines are
	implemented, but only the immediate command parsing has been
	fully tested) along with the test program test_parser.  The
	previous test programs and binaries are no longer included to
	reduce the size of the file (obtain them from the 0.0.4
	release).  New (listed first) and updated files include:

	parser.cpp      - contains the Parser class functions
	parser1.txt     - output from the test_parser program
	test_parser.cpp - source file for the test_parser program
	test_parser.vpj - project file for the test_parser program

	ibcp.h          - added Parser class and other structures
	table.cpp       - minor editing changes


Release 0.0.4 (2010-02-18)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.3.  The Table class has been
	implemented.  New file ibcp.h is the main include file for the
	project and for now contains enumerations, structures and
	classes needed for the Table class.  Test programs include
	test_cons for testing exception throwing from constructors (but
	otherwise unrelated to the project) and test_table for testing
	the various Table functions.  New and updated files include:

	codes.txt       - file listed codes and their values
	ibcp.h          - main include file
	list.h          - updated with minor changes
	table.cpp       - contains entries and Table class functions
	test_cons.cpp   - source file for the test_cons program
	test_cons.vpj   - project file for the test_cons program
	test_table.cpp  - source file for the test_table program
	test_table.vpj  - project file for the test_table program


Release 0.0.3 (2010-01-30)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.2.  The List class has been
	updated to have more list-like functions.  The test_stack
	program has been updated to include a new test list function.
	Updated files:

	list.h         - made member functions more list like
	string.cpp     - added length of zero check to constructors
	test_stack.cpp - added additional list tests


Release 0.0.2 (2010-01-15)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.1 except for Makefile.v (VIDE2
	will rebuild Makefile after loading first project, after this
	user Project/Rebuild Makefile menu command to create Makefile.v
	for project loaded) plus new files for String class, source file
	to test the functionality of the String class, and a source file
	to test the conversion of strings to numbers.  Project files now
	setup to run with GCC 4.4.0 (using MinGw).  New files included:

	rel_notes.txt   - this file
	string.h        - string class definition file
	string.cpp      - string class functions
	test_string.cpp - string test source file
	test_string.vpj - VIDE2 project file for test_string program
	test_nums.cpp   - numbers test source file
	test_nums.vpj   - VIDE2 project file for test_nums program


Release 0.0.1 (2009-12-29)

	Contains List template class along with source file to test the
	functionality of the List class.  Makefile and VIDE2 project
	file setup to run with free Borland C++ 5.5 Command Line Tools.
	Files included:

	list.h         - list template class definition file
	test_stack.cpp - stack test source file
	test_stack.vpj - VIDE2 project file for test_stack program
	Makefile.v     - VIDE2 generated Borland C++ 5.5 makefile
