Release 0.1.4-dev-2 (2010-03-20)

	Interim developmental release - Simple expressions has been

	release was missing the test_parser.cpp file.  New (listed
	first) and updated files include:

Release 0.1.2 (2010-03-13)

	Contains files from Release 0.1.1, where Translator development
	initiated.  Only contains minor changes, but now the new ibcp.cpp

	(listed first) and updated files include:

	ibcp.cpp        - contains main(), calls test_parser()

Release 0.1.1 (2010-03-11)

	Contains files from Release 0.1.0 updated for new command line
	-i option to test_parser program to allow interactive input (so

	Updated files include:

	parser.cpp      - modified to allow tab character as whitespace
	test_parser.cpp - new command line option for interactive input


Release 0.1.0 (2010-03-10)

	tested.  New (listed first) and updated files include:

	parser5.txt     - string output from the test_parser program

	parser.cpp      - rewrote operator parser code
	table.cpp       - corrected 2 character operator table entries

Release 0.0.8 (2010-03-08)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.7 updated after testing the
	parser string routines.  New (listed first) and updated
	files include:

	parser4.txt     - string output from the test_parser program

	parser.cpp      - removed no closing quote check
	test_parser.cpp - added string tests

	files include:

	parser3.txt     - number output from the test_parser program

	ibcp.h          - added token error length
	parser.cpp      - added token error length

	test_parser.cpp - changed error output, added number tests


Release 0.0.6 (2010-03-06)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.5 updated after testing the
	parser identifier routines.  New (listed first) and updated
	files include:

	parser2.txt     - identifier output from the test_parser program

	ibcp.h          - corrected problem with define functions
	parser.cpp      - corrected problem with define functions
	table.cpp       - fixed data type for internal string functions
	test_parser.cpp - command line argument, added identifier tests


Release 0.0.5 (2010-03-01)

	Contains files from Release 0.0.4 plus the initial
	implementation of the Parser class (all parser routines are
	implemented, but only the immediate command parsing has been
	fully tested) along with the test program test_parser.  The

	classes needed for the Table class.  Test programs include
	test_cons for testing exception throwing from constructors (but
	otherwise unrelated to the project) and test_table for testing
	the various Table functions.  New and updated files include:

	list.h         - made member functions more list like
	string.cpp     - added length of zero check to constructors
	test_stack.cpp - added additional list tests

	Contains files from Release 0.0.1 except for Makefile.v (VIDE2
	will rebuild Makefile after loading first project, after this
	user Project/Rebuild Makefile menu command to create Makefile.v
	for project loaded) plus new files for String class, source file
	to test the functionality of the String class, and a source file
	to test the conversion of strings to numbers.  Project files now
	setup to run with GCC 4.4.0 (using MinGw).  New files included:

	rel_notes.txt   - this file
	string.h        - string class definition file
