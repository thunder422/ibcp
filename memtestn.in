#  2013-07-13  temporary script (based on memtest.in)
#
#
#  Usage:
#    regtestn
#
#  Details:
#    output files are directed to current (IBCP) directory, and then
#    comparing to the established output files in the test directory
#    reporting any changes as FAIL; also checks for memory issues
#    (including memory leaks) and reports a failure if any
#
#  Notes:
#    memory checking requires the valgrind utility, which is only
#    available on Linux
