#  Change History:
#
#  2010-05-29  initial release
#  2010-06-10  added translator tests 10 and 11
#  2010-06-29  added translator test 12
#  2010-07-04  added translator test 13
#  2011-01-04  added translator test 14
#  2011-01-09  changed name of executable from ibcp to ibcp.exe to make
#              it work properly on Linux (this still works under windows;
#              before the .exe was being added automatically)
#  2011-02-05  added translator test 15
#  2011-03-20  added translator test 16
#  2011-03-27  added translator test 17
#
#  2012-10-13  renamed to regtest.in so that source directory can be
#              confingured when cmake is run; replaced the parser and
#              translator test loops with a single loop that tests all the
#              available *.dat test input files
#  2012-10-22  added "./" in front of "ibcp" so that program can be run without
#              having to have "." in the current PATH
#
#  2012-10-29  added version output
#
#
#  Usage:
#    regtest
#
#  Details:
#    output files are directed to current (IBCP) directory, and then
#    comparing to the established output files in the test directory
#    reporting any changes as FAIL
#

rm -f parser*.txt expression*.txt translator*.txt
dir=@ibcp_SOURCE_DIR@/test/
./ibcp -v
for input in ${dir}parser*.dat ${dir}expression*.dat ${dir}translator*.dat
do
	base=${input##*/}
	output=${base%.dat}.txt
	./ibcp -t $input >$output
	cmp -s $dir$output $output
	if [ $? -eq 0 ]
	then
		echo Test File $base... OK
	else
		echo Test File $base... FAIL
	fi
done
